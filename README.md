# Textagons ⬢ ⬡
This is a Pygame implementation of the classic Flash game "Bookworm" by PopCap. Click neighboring tiles to spell words, clicking the last selected tile to submit a word. Spell the **Bonus word** for a score multiplier.

### Changes to the original game
* Hexagons instead of staggered square tiles. Because BattleTech, probably.
* Right click a tile to mark it. This makes it easy to keep track of tiles you want to save for future bonus words.

### TODO
* Add fire tiles & logic
* "Clear all marked" button
* Show word history?
* Show best/longest word?
